# 🎯 Aim Trainer

This is my **very first web project** — a simple and interactive **Aim Trainer** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It was created to practice my front-end development skills while building a small but fun game that tests precision and reflexes.

⚡ This is my first web development project — built with curiosity and a desire to learn. I’m continuously improving it as I progress.
